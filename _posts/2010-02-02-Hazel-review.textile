<span>&quot;</span> Debbie has been a fantastic teacher for me over the past few years, helping me improve my musical ability and getting me through my piano exams. 

I love how she ignites my delight in playing the piano every week when I go to her lessons and she never shouts even when i forget to practice! She knows exactly how to poke me into achieving what I'm capable of without pressurising me into doing more than I can. <span>&quot;</span>
