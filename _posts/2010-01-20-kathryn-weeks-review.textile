I am a 27 year old who had always wanted to play the piano. I started lessons with Debbie nearly 2 years ago and have really enjoyed my journey from a complete beginner to somebody who can now read music and play a variety of different pieces. 

I think I have progressed really well and stuck at it so long because Debbie is a really patient teacher who is great to learn with. 

She makes sure lessons are fun and varied but always knows when you need a little push to progress and will make sure you get the most out of your lessons. 

Her style of teaching makes the whole process of learning the piano very enjoyable and rewarding.
