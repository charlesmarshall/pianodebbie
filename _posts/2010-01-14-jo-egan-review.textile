<span>&quote;</span> I am a 43 and started to learn the piano from scratch last year. I could not read music and had a bit of a mental block about it as I had never managed to stick to learning an instrument when I was a child. 

Debbie is a brilliant teacher - she has de-mystified music for me. She is very encouraging but also firm, which is what I needed as it ensured that I did my practice between lessons! I really enjoy my lessons with Debbie - we do a mixture of scales and pieces. 

I wasn't planning to do exams but Debbie encouraged me to take Grade 1 recently and I passed with a merit - something I never thought I'd achieve! <span>&quote;</span>
