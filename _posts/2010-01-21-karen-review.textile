My return to piano after 30 years has been rewarded thanks to the patient and intelligent teaching Debbie provides. Looking back to where I started, I can see a massive improvement both in my playing and understanding of music theory. 

Debbie combines gentle encouragement with criticism and is superb at setting appropriate pieces which are both challenging and enjoyable.
