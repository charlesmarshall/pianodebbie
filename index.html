<p class='intro'>Thank you for visiting my website. I am a piano teacher based in the south birmingham area. I teach all ages from 5 to 105, all levels, beginners are very welcome. I have much experience teaching for grades or just for fun. I also work as an accompanist for primary schools, choirs, theatre companies and have been a church organist for the past 5 years.</p>

On the website you will find reviews from past and current pupils, my own favourite repertoire list as well as some fun piano games to get you practising!

Please do get in contact with me by email or phone if you have any enquiries regarding lessons or accompanying.
